It can be used for securtiy testing and for knowledge on how to create Keyloggers.

Myself. It was based on the Keylogger program from the "Complete Ethical Hacking Course" on Udemy. I then edited the code and added the mailing feature to enhance it.

**What this Github contains**

It contains the source code, the executable, and a jpeg embedded with the keylogger.

**Is it completed?**

No, I'm still working on the mailing feature.

**What do I for future implementations?**

I want to possibly add a GUI version as well.
